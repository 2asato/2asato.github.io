In making "Guess That Emoji," I used html, css, javascript and jquery.  Most of the elements of the page were put on directly in the html with only a couple being added with jquery.  The same goes for the styling with almost all styling being done in css and a few through jquery.

I started out with the general layout of the page first.  After that I started on the code.  I had a hard time getting going and wasn't sure exactly how to start.  I was able to get the main aspects of my code going but then got stuck putting all the pieces together.  Being stuck on the code I moved on to focusing on the styling until I could get help with the code.  When I was finally able to get help Todd and James both offered their input and ideas and were able to lead me down a path in which everything started falling into place.

There are a few bugs and things I'd like to fix and change when given the time.
  - storing the high score on the page and not having it reset on reload of page
  - disabling and turning back on buttons at certain points of round
  - the color of the answers background not being colored after first round
  - restart actually being a restart and not just reloading the page
  - styling, sizing for different screen sizes
  - not having duplicate emojis after its already been used
